steps:
Setup a GitHub Account

Username - Please pick a publicly & humanly readable username! Do not use your Bosch User ID (ntuser) here!

Create the account with your email address, this can also be a non-business email. Chose any email address you use except ntuser@bosch.com.

Here is some more information around the GitHub Account.

Log in.

Go to https://github.com/settings/emails

Add ntuser@bosch.com (<NT User> replace this with your real userid)

Verify the email address

Activate two-factor authentication - https://github.com/settings/security

You need an authenticator app to enable 2FA, there is no preferred app.

Make sure you set and document your recovery codes in a secure place. We have no access to these settings and cannot provide any support.
